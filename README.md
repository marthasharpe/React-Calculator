# React Calculator

### A simple calculator made using React.js.

This was a project for the Front End Libraries Certification through freeCodeCamp.  
There is a lot of logic that goes into creating even a very simple calculator!  
It took me a while to break down all the different conditions and edge-cases involved.

Note: This calculator uses immediate-execution, meaning it immediately applies the most recent operator to the most recent number. It will not give an accurate output for an equation with several operators. (I got a lot of comments about this.)
